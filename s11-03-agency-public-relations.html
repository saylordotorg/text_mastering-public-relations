<span class="title-prefix">10.3</span> Agency Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_p01">In addition to in-house departments, most organizations—from small firms to huge global entities—work in partnership with public relations agencies to develop and implement communication programs. These agencies generate billions of dollars in revenue, employ thousands of counselors, and serve as the source of training and development for hundreds of young entrants to the field each year.</p>
    <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Agency Definitions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p01">There are four major types of public relations agencies. They range from full service agencies to specialists who fill a particular organizational or client need. Further, they range from being units of larger, umbrella organizations to individually owned agencies.</p>
        <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Full Service Agencies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s01_p01">Some of the largest agencies offer a full spectrum of services, from traditional media relations and event planning to highly specialized research, training, and social media expertise. Some of these large agencies, such as Ketchum, Burson Marsteller, Weber Shandwick, Porter Novelli, and Fleishman-Hillard are part of large media conglomerates like Omnicom, WPP, and Interpublic. A number of large agencies, most notably Edelman, have remained independent.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Public relations agencies that offer a spectrum of services, from traditional media relations and event planning to highly specialized research, training, and social media expertise. </span></span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p01">Agencies such as APCO Worldwide are recognized primarily for their expertise in public affairs. These agencies focus on developing advocacy positions for or against legislative initiatives, organizing grassroots campaigns, lobbying members of Congress and other government leaders or coaching their clients to do so, and participating in and often leading coalitions that link together like-minded members.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Public relations agencies that help organizations navigate public policy both globally and locally.</span></span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s03_p01">Kekst, Sard Verbinnen, Abernathy MacGregor, and others focus specifically on what often is referred to as “strategic communication,” including mergers and acquisitions, investor relations, and defending hostile takeovers. These agencies are brought in to supplement corporate staff and agencies of record when a company decides to make a major move, such as buying another company or selling a large subsidiary. They are also retained when a company is facing an unwanted takeover by another firm. It is common for both parties in hostile takeover attempts to retain competing strategic agencies. These are often waged in highly publicized battles that command the front pages of major media for days. The strategic counselors develop long-term relationships with a few key mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) reporters for <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, and others, which they try to use as leverage on behalf of their clients.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Public relations agencies that focus on strategic communications, including mergers and acquisitions, investor relations, and the defense of hostile takeovers.</span></span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s04_p01">Corporate identity specialists—Landor, FutureBrand, InterBrand, and others—develop branding strategies and programs for both organizations and brands. These agencies utilize extensive research to develop brand platforms for their clients that build on the existing perceptions of companies or their products. Their expertise includes graphic design, naming, brand engagement programs for employees, and complete identity systems.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Public relations agencies that help organizations develop brand strategies and programs for organizations and brands.</span></span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_s05_p01">In recent years a number of agencies have chosen to specialize in corporate philanthropy programs. They work with clients to determine areas in which they can match their areas of expertise with global human needs, such as hunger, health, the environment, and poverty. They design programs that help address these needs by utilizing the employees, technical expertise, and financial resources of their clients.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Trends in Agencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Regardless of their particular area of focus, all of these agencies are being affected by a number of new industry trends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p02">According to a survey conducted by the Council of Public Relations Firms, the industry’s trade association, agencies are finding that their clients are increasing their <em class="emphasis">outsourcing</em> practices. With pressures on profit margins intensifying, many companies find that they can better manage the ebbs and flows of communication activity by hiring an outside agency for certain communication activities in lieu of using internal staff.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_002">Council of Public Relations Firms Web site (2009).</span> When times are good and the needs multiply, organizations can increase the amount of agency support they receive; when times are lean they can cut back the support of outside firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p03">Companies and agencies are also using more <em class="emphasis">virtual teams</em>, meaning teams that include the client’s employees, the agency’s employees, and independent contractors all working on the same project.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_003">Council of Public Relations Firms Web site (2009).</span> In many cases, these teams are located in different offices, cities, time zones, even continents, all connected through the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p04">Most agencies are expected to provide strategic counsel, not just tactical solutions that involve executing programs. In order to do this effectively, the agency team must employ thorough <em class="emphasis">external research</em> that identifies pending issues and opportunities for the client. Their recommendations often go beyond the realm of communication, challenging the organization to consider the implications of policy changes or major operational decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p05">Regardless of how the agency-client relationship is structured, clients expect the agency to anticipate issues and provide a fresh perspective that can assist them in making critical decisions and recommendations to their CEOs and internal publics and colleagues. To do this well, the agency team must spend time conducting <em class="emphasis">internal research</em>—getting to know the unique aspects of their client’s business. These aspects normally include competitive threats, labor relationships, legislative and regulatory constraints, and the global trends that will affect the future of the business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p06">Most large agencies have a <em class="emphasis">global reach</em>, they operate global networks, with major offices in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Some do this with their own employees and others form partnerships and networks with independent agencies in other countries. Either way, it is increasingly important for multinational clients to be able to call upon an agency that can offer counsel throughout the world.</p>

    <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Agency Life Versus Corporate Life</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p01">The resumes of many practitioners often include experience in both agency and corporate positions, and many of the management responsibilities of the corporate CCO are also conducted by agency professionals. Agency professionals oftentimes build an area of expertise with long-term service for a client or within an industry, and work as expert prescribers resolving problems and crises as an outside consultant from the agency, and return to their agencies once the problem is solved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p02">The agency world offers the opportunity for varied assignments with multiple clients. A career path through the agency can provide opportunities in a wide range of areas, including media relations, issues management, crises management, brand building, event planning, and corporate reputation work. To some, one of the negative aspects of entry-level jobs in agencies is that they are highly focused on conducting events, publicity, and media pitching.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p03">On the corporate side, most employees, especially at the entry level, are focused on a single industry or line of business. Since corporate departments are often smaller, the career path may be more limited, whereas agencies may have a diverse client list and numerous opportunities for travel. On the other hand, corporate communication positions can provide a more strategic focus, depending on the company. From a practical standpoint, the benefits offered in corporations are usually better for new hires, though this is not always the case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p04">Clearly, the line between corporate and agency roles is becoming less distinct. With the use of virtual teams increasing, clients are more focused on results than on the demarcation between the agency and the corporation. In both worlds, leaders are looking for ways to improve their value to the organization, whether they are serving internal or external clients.</p>
