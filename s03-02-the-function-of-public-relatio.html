<span class="title-prefix">2.2</span> The Function of Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">In 1982, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) adopted the following definition of public relations that helps identify its purpose: “Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn02_002">Public Relations Society of America (2009b).</span> In its “Official Statement on Public Relations,” PRSA goes on to clarify the function of public relations:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s02_l01">
        <li> Public relations helps our complex, pluralistic society to reach decisions and function more effectively by contributing to mutual understanding among groups and institutions. It serves to bring private and public policies into harmony.</li>
        <li> Public relations serves a wide variety of institutions in society such as businesses, trade unions, government agencies, voluntary associations, foundations, hospitals, schools, colleges and religious institutions. To achieve their goals, these institutions must develop effective relationships with many different audiences or publics such as employees, members, customers, local communities, shareholders and other institutions, and with society at large.</li>
        <li> The managements of institutions need to understand the attitudes and values of their publics in order to achieve institutional goals. The goals themselves are shaped by the external environment. The public relations practitioner acts as a counselor to management and as a mediator, helping to translate private aims into reasonable, publicly acceptable policy and action.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn02_003">Public Relations Society of America (2009a).</span>
</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s02_p02">As such, the public relations <em class="emphasis">field</em> has grown to encompass the building of important relationships between an organization and its key publics through its actions and its communication. This perspective defines the field as a management function and offers insight into the roles and responsibilities of public relations professionals. The PRSA definition, however, is not perfect: A main weakness of that definition is that it requires public relations “to bring private and public policies into harmony.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn02_004">Public Relations Society of America (2009b).</span> In reality, we know that the relationships an organization has with all of its publics cannot always be harmonious. Further, that definition obligates us to act in the best interest of both the organization and its publics, which could be logically impossible if those interests are diametrically opposed. A few examples would be class action litigation, boycotts, and oppositional research and lobbying; despite the negative nature of those relationships, they still require public relations management and communication.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s02_p03">The unique management function of public relations is critical to the success of any organization that engages people in its operation, whether they are shareholders, employees, or customers. Although many people think of publicity as the sole purpose of public relations, this text will help you understand that publicity is a subfunction of the overall purpose of public relations and should not be confused with the broader function.</p>
