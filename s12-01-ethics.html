<span class="title-prefix">11.1</span> Ethics</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_p01">Questions of how to guide behavior and differentiate between right and wrong have intrigued mankind for thousands of years. From the ancient philosophy of Plato and Aristotle to the Enlightenment of Hume, Kant, Mill, and the theoretical approach of Jesus, Buddha, Confucius, Mohammad, and Aquinas, to modern-day philosophy, we explore the questions of right versus wrong, good versus evil, light versus darkness. Singer averred, “Ethics is about how we ought to live.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_001">Singer (1994), p. 3.</span> Given Singer’s simple definition of ethics, public relations ethics is about how we <em class="emphasis">ought</em> to communicate. Much goes on behind that communication for the public relations professional. Issues managers must identify potential problems, research must be conducted, and both problems and potential solutions must be defined in an ethical manner. Therefore, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethics</a><span class="glossdef">In public relations, moral principles defined as how decisions, management items, and communication ought to be conducted.</span></span> can be defined for public relations as <em class="emphasis">how we ought to decide</em>, <em class="emphasis">manage</em>, <em class="emphasis">and communicate</em>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics and Trust</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Communication is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the ultimate goal of public relations. Our goal is building <em class="emphasis">relationships</em> through the use of ethical communication, listening, and strategic alliances, while collaboratively incorporating the ideas of others into organizational policy. We try to build both the means and fluency to create dialogue with our publics. If the purpose of public relations is to build relationships with publics, trust is an essential part of any ongoing relationship. Whether those publics are inside the organization, such as employees, management, administrative workers, or outside the organization, such as suppliers, distributors, retailers, consumers, communities, and governments, ethics is the linchpin that holds together relationships.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p02">To understand the importance of ethics in relationships, imagine the following scenario. If you purchased a product from a company that advertises that it is the highest quality, you might feel exploited were you to find out that the organization sold the product knowing it was manufactured with defective components. Chances are, you would not want to have a long-term relationship with that organization, meaning that you would not become a repeat purchaser of their product. Through this simple example it becomes apparent that the ethics of an organization have a nebulous yet certain impact upon relationships with publics.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ethical Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Ethics intersects with all levels of an organization. From the assembly line to middle management, ethics must play a role in decision making in order for an organization to be the most successful that it can possibly be. To be certain, much of the responsibility for ethics rests at the top of the organization, because without a vision and leadership from the top instilling the importance of ethics and the values of the organization, ethical behavior tends not to flourish. In other words, <em class="emphasis">public relations should act as the ethical conscience of the organization</em> by including the views of publics in decision making, but everyone in the organization must value ethics, most importantly the leaders of an organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p02">This multipronged ethics function is what ethicists call “institutionalizing corporate conscience.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_002">Goodpaster (2007).</span> The ethics function must be a part not only of public relations but also of the corporate culture. This section will show you how to identify values, instill ethical values throughout the organization’s culture, and consider and resolve ethical dilemmas.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Systems Theory Rationale for Ethics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01">Many entry and midlevel public relations professionals often wonder how they got into the territory of philosophy and ethical decision making. Allow us to explain the answer in terms of systems theory and you will soon understand why a working knowledge of moral philosophy is an absolute must for the public relations manager.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p02">As a specialized field, public relations is in danger of being myopic or atomized. Laszlo explained that such specialized knowledge can form a barrier to entry and result in isolation, meaning that reality is viewed in fragments rather than holistically.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_003">Laszlo (1996).</span> The contrasting view is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">systems theory</a><span class="glossdef">The viewpoint that an organization is a system comprised of smaller subsystems. Public relations functions to communicate both among the organization's subsystems and with the organization's consumers and other publics.</span></span>, similar to biological systems or ecological systems, such as the body being comprised of a circulatory system, a nervous system, a digestive system, and so on. This organic view of systems was applied to society by the philosopher Luhmann to explain society as comprised of interdependent but somewhat autonomous social systems comprising the larger whole.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_004">Luhmann (1984).</span> In organizational terms, an organization is a system comprised of smaller subsystems. Public relations is the function that communicates both among the subsystems of an organization and with its external environment, comprised of consumers and other publics. In systems theory terms, the <strong class="emphasis bold">environment</strong> is anything outside of the conceptual “boundary” of the organization. Those inside the boundary of the organization normally have a financial relationship with it; those in the environment can come and go across the boundary of the organization as consultants, for example, or they can exist wholly within the environment. Information freely crosses this boundary both as inputs to the organization when research is conducted, and output from the organization when it communicates with external publics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p03">In systems theory terms, public relations is a part of the management subsystem (see <a class="xref" href="#bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_n01">Note 11.3 "The Organizational Subsystems Within Systems Theory"</a>). Similar to a nervous system, management is the brain of the organization and communication is used to coordinate its activities. The other subfunctions in a typical organization are occupied with their own areas of expertise, yet public relations must interact with them both in collecting data, identifying potential issues or problems, socializing new employees, and building organizational culture. These activities require an enormous amount of communication, listening, collaborative problem solving, and management skill. Public relations managers enact this internal communication function both across organizational subsystems, from management in a top-down fashion, and back to management when reporting on the internal state of affairs. Essentially, public relations acts as a communication conduit that facilitates the smooth internal operations of an organization.</p>

            <p class="para" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_n01_p01">An open system is interdependent with its environment; the environment supplies many necessities of production, including labor, and the information necessary to adjust to market trends and manage the organization effectively. Closed systems are rare, as most organizations have varying degrees of interdependence with their environments, and thus, varying degrees of openness.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Boundary Spanning and Counseling on Ethics</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_s01_p01">Public relations practitioners also span the boundary of an organization in maintaining relationships with publics in the external environment. When they cross this boundary in order to collect data, either formally or informally, they are known as “boundary spanners.” Public relations managers scan the environment looking for messages of concern, and changing trends, thereby identifying problems with their publics within their industry. This process of monitoring the environment for potential issues of concern is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">environmental scanning</a><span class="glossdef">The process of monitoring the environment for potential issues of concern and changing trends in order to identify problems with an organization's publics.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_005">Stoffels (1994).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_s01_p02">By acting as boundary spanners, maintaining relationships with publics outside the organization, and collecting information from outside the organization through environmental scanning, the public relations function is perfectly situated to advise on ethical matters. Understanding the values of publics with whom the organization has relationships is enormously valuable because their ethical values can be represented in management decision making by the public relations manager. She or he is already familiar with the strategic publics in the environment of the organization, their desires, priorities, and issues with the organization. The relationships the public relations managers seek to build and maintain are a source of valuable input and information during ethical decision making because those publics can be consulted on issues important to them. The public relations manager is tasked with representing those views in top management decision-making sessions. No other organizational function is better suited to understand the needs and values of external publics than is the communication function. The legal department, no doubt, is well versed in understanding government and regulatory publics, but will have little knowledge of the values of publics extending beyond the legislative arena. Likewise, the marketing function will be knowledgeable about the values of consumers, but will have little knowledge of the values of the communities surrounding manufacturing sites. Only public relations fills this knowledge gap in terms of systems theory. By understanding and incorporating the values of publics, more ethically inclusive, diverse, pluralistic decisions can be made. These decisions result in a greater harmony between the organization and publics over time, fewer lawsuits, fewer disgruntled publics, fewer boycotts, and can prevent an expensive loss of reputation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics Counseling: Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_s02_p01">One caveat to using a systems perspective to justify why public relations should act as an ethical counsel to senior management is that few public relations practitioners have actually studied ethics in a rigorous manner. Those who have studied ethics are likely to be more senior-level professionals, reporting to the top of their organization (normally the chief executive officer [CEO]), earning an above average salary, and the majority are male. This finding does not mean that younger, entry or mid-level and female professionals have less ethical reasoning ability, only that they have fewer chances in which to advise their organizations on ethical choices. Ethics study and training are encouraged as a way to remedy this problem; we will delve into moral deliberation shortly.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Is Public Relations in the Dominant Coalition?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s03_p01">A caveat of using public relations as an ethics counsel is that the public relations manager must have a seat at the senior management table in order to advise on these matters. The worldwide International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) study discussed later found that 30% of public relations professionals report directly to the CEO, 35% report one level below the CEO or have a dotted line (indirect) reporting relationship to the CEO. That finding is good news because it means that about 65% of public relations professionals worldwide have access to their CEOs and say they advise at least occasionally on ethical matters. However, the remaining 35% of public relations professionals reported no access to their senior management, meaning that they are not at the table when important ethical decisions are made, nor can they advise or give input on these decisions. Professionals oftentimes have little influence on policy, and the ethical decisions they must face are smaller in magnitude, often dealing with only technical aspects of the public relations function. For those, ethics study is often needed in order to advance their ascent into management.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Public Relations: Ethical Conscience Adviser</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_p01">Should public relations advise on ethics? The public relations practitioners in a worldwide study reported the highest levels of agreement to these statements: “Ethical considerations are a vital part of executive decision-making” (mean 4.61 of 5.0 maximum) and “public relations practitioners should advise management on ethical matters” (mean 4.12 of 5.0 maximum).<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_006">Bowen, Heath, Lee, Painter, Agraz, McKie, et al. (2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_p02">Clearly, there is agreement in the industry that management must consider ethics and that the role of ethical counsel falls on the shoulders of the public relations manager. Managers of communication need to consider two ethical roles and learn the basis of ethics to foster their ability to enact each. These two distinct ethical roles were first identified by the IABC <em class="emphasis">Business of Truth</em> study and also have been found in subsequent research.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_007">See Bowen, Heath, Lee, Painter, Agraz, McKie, et al. (2006); Bowen (2008), pp. 271–296.</span> The first role is managing the values inside the organization, including conducting ethics training. The second role is helping to analyze and deliberate ethical decisions alongside top management incorporating the knowledge of publics gained through boundary spanning. We will study each role thoroughly to prepare you for the many ethical challenges to be managed as a professional communicator.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics Role 1: Organizational Values—The “Chicken Versus Egg” Dilemma</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p01">All organizations have a certain personality that scholars call organizational culture, and that culture also has values or values certain concepts above others.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_008">Goodpaster (2007); Sims and Brinkman (2003), pp. 243–256.</span> Even a lack of concrete values <em class="emphasis">is</em> a value of sorts. Will organizations, particularly profit-seeking businesses, take a citizenship role in society? Or will they use society to achieve their own ends? These types of questions can help you discern the values of organizations. Looking specifically at an organization, you can assess the values it holds by reading mission statements,<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_009">Bowen and Broom (2005).</span> policy documents,<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_010">Seeger (1997).</span> codes of conduct, and ethics statements;<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_011">Murphy (1998).</span> examining the statements of leaders<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_012">Kidder (2005).</span> and its statements toward publics<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_013">Curtin and Boynton (2001).</span> and communities;<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_014">Leeper (1996), pp. 163–179.</span> and the use of the organization’s Web site as a dialogue building tool or simply as an advertisement.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_015">Bowen (2009b, August 7).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p02">The reason we referred to a chicken and egg dilemma is because it is very difficult to determine whether ethical individuals drive ethical behavior or organizational culture drives ethical behavior, and which one comes first. Is it possible to turn an organization that holds little regard for ethics into an ethically exemplary one? Can ethics thrive in an organization in which the CEO cares little for such pursuits? What if the CEO exemplifies ethical leadership but takes over a historically unethical organization? Public relations is inextricably involved in questions such as these because it is responsible for communicating with internal publics, for helping to create and drive an enduring mission of the organization, and for helping foster an organizational culture that is responsible and includes the views of publics outside the organization.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p03">The answer to the chicken and egg dilemma certainly varies according to organization and industry. However, ethicists generally hold that an organizational culture valuing ethics is more important than individuals.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_016">Sims (1994).</span> Even the most ethically conscientious employee could not have prevented the bankruptcy of Enron.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_017">Sims and Brinkman (2003), pp. 243–256.</span> One study exploring the chicken and egg dilemma concluded that an ethical organizational culture must be in place to foster and reward ethical decision making, lest an ethical individual making commendable decisions will not be encouraged or rewarded for doing so and thus cannot change the organizational culture toward the ethical.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_018">Bowen (2000).</span> In fact, organizations supportive of ethical decision making incorporate ethical debate and deliberation as a highly valued activity in their organizational culture.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_019">Bowen (2004b), pp. 311–324.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p04">In order to act on this knowledge, the public relations function is responsible for helping to learn the values of the organization through conducting internal research and to refine and encourage the laudable values. Building an organizational culture focused on ethics takes much time and effort and a consistent commitment to communicate about not only the importance of organizational values but also the crucial role and decision making of ethical analyses. Contrary to what some managers believe, ethical decisions are not “easy” but come into play when many valid and competing views are present.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_020">Bowen (2002), pp. 270–283; Goldberg (1993).</span> Building an organizational culture in which ethical debate is encouraged comes from delineating the organization’s values, then reiterating those values consistently so that all employees know them, thereby encouraging the application of discussion of those values. Requiring ethics training at all levels of the organization is also necessary, as is insisting that leaders “walk the talk” to acting ethically and modeling ethical behavior.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_021">Parks (1993).</span> They should evaluate employees based on their identification of ethical issues or conflicts, and reward ethical behavior. Ethics training is normally conducted by the public relations function or an internal relations specialist from the public relations department. It can take many forms, from online training to in-person retreats, to workbook modules, or discussion of case studies. The essential component of acting as a values manager for your organization is in identifying what the organization holds as a value and working to keep that concept central in all decisions throughout the organization.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p05">For example, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (J&amp;J) well-publicized credo values the patients who use their products first, as their primary public. Therefore, patient-centered decisions dominate the decision-making framework when ethics are discussed at J&amp;J. We can contrast that with an organization who values the bottom line above all other pursuits, a company who values innovation, one who values responsibility, or one who values respect. Different values of importance in the decision-making framework will result in a different organizational culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s01_p06">Through the communication outlets of internal relations such as employee Web sites, intranet, magazines, newspapers, blogs, and other communication channels, the public relations function can work to both understand the current values of internal publics and to instill the desired ethical values into the organizational culture. Ethical training programs could be used to educate employees of all levels on the values and ethical decision-making paradigm of the organization. It is important to have clarity and a vision of ethical values that is reinforced at all levels of the organization. Consistency, clarity, repetition, and a reward system in place for ethical decision making often speed the rate at which internal publics adapt to and adopt the values of the organization.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn11_022">Goodpaster (2007).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethics Role 2: Ethical Counselor to Management</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s02_p01">A second approach to ethics that public relations managers can take in an organization is to advise or counsel senior management on ethical decisions. The public relations counselor is perfectly situated in an organization to know the values of publics, and can help to incorporate those views of publics into strategic decisions and planning. She or he can discuss these issues with the CEO and advise him or her on how ethical decisions would impact the reputation of the organization.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s02_p02">Ethical decision-making paradigms and analyses are not usually necessary if there is a clear right and wrong in the situation. Ethical paradigms for moral analyses are helpful when there are two or more conflicting arguments of merit. If there are many “right” points of view then it is time to use an ethical decision-making paradigm to decide which decision alternative is most congruent with the values of the organization. The issues management team meetings can include the views of publics when the public relations professional is present to represent them in these meetings. Additionally, the public relations manager can use ethical decision-making frameworks to analyze the situation from multiple perspectives, and to advise the CEO and executive management on the morally desirable course of action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch11_s01_s05_s02_p03">Advising the CEO on ethics requires a number of qualifications on the part of the public relations manager. Training in ethics or moral philosophy is essential for ethical analysis, and that training can be academic or professional in nature. It is a must that the public relations manager understand the basics of moral reasoning in order to conduct thorough analyses and advise the CEO on ethics. The analysis of competing and valid decisions is a difficult, exceedingly complex pursuit. Having a public relations manager devoted to conducting these intensive analyses is sometimes the only way that a CEO can hear a countervailing point of view, as these executives are often surrounded by “yes men” who provide no critical analysis in the decision at hand. To prevent the sort of group think that often occurs in these situations, it is vital that the public relations executive be as objective as possible in the analyses of ethical decisions. Providing an objective ethical analysis to the CEO is one way that public relations adds value to the effectiveness of the organization.</p>
