<span class="title-prefix">2.3</span> Naming the Public Relations Function</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">A plethora of terms has come to be associated with modern-day public relations practice. Because of the disreputable beginnings of public relations that we will briefly discuss next, it is often the case that organizations will choose to name their public relations function by another moniker. These various terms create much confusion about the responsibilities of public relations versus overlapping or competing organizational functions. The term corporate communication is the most common synonym for public relations in practice today,<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn02_005">Bowen et al. (2006).</span> followed by marketing communication and public affairs. We view the term corporate communication as a synonym for public relations, although some scholars argue that corporate communication only applies to for-profit organizations. However, we view <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corporate communication</a><span class="glossdef">A goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations, educational foundations, activist groups, faith-based organizations, and other groups. Generally synonymous to the term <em class="emphasis">public relations</em>, it is also referred to as <em class="emphasis">strategic public relations</em> and <em class="emphasis">strategic communication management</em>.</span></span> as a <em class="emphasis">goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations</em>, <em class="emphasis">educational foundations</em>, <em class="emphasis">activist groups</em>, <em class="emphasis">faith-based organizations</em>, <em class="emphasis">and so on</em>. The term public relations often leads to confusion between the media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, and marketing promotions, leading many organizations to prefer the term corporate communication.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">We believe that the key component of effective public relations or corporate communication is an element of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A plan or method employed toward the accomplishment of a specific goal or goals. </span></span>. Many scholars prefer to use the phrase <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategic public relations</a><span class="glossdef">A goal-oriented communication process more commonly referred to as <em class="emphasis">corporate communication</em>.  May also be referred to as <em class="emphasis">strategic communication management</em>.</span></span> to differentiate it from the often misunderstood general term public relations, or “PR,” which can be linked to manipulation or “spin” in the minds of lay publics. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Strategic communication management</a><span class="glossdef">A goal-oriented communication process more commonly referred to as <em class="emphasis">corporate communication</em>.  May also be referred to as <em class="emphasis">strategic public relations</em>.</span></span>, strategic public relations, and corporate communication are synonyms for the concept displayed in the preceding definitions. To scholars in the area, public relations is seen as the larger profession and an umbrella term, comprising many smaller subfunctions, such as media relations or public affairs or investor relations. The subfunctions of public relations will be delineated later in this chapter. Academics tend to use the term public relations, whereas professionals tend to prefer the term corporate communication. Do not be distracted by the name debate and the myriad of synonyms possible. Whatever name you prefer or encounter, a strong body of knowledge in the field, based on academic study and professional practice, has solidified the importance of the concepts supporting the strategic communication function that we will discuss in this text.</p>
