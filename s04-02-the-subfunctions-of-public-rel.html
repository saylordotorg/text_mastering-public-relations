<span class="title-prefix">3.2</span> The Subfunctions of Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_p01">Before we delve deeper into the profession, we would like to introduce you to the subfunctions or specialties within public relations. Think of the public relations function as a large umbrella profession encompassing many subfunctions. Those subfunctions are often independent units within an organization, sometimes reporting to public relations and sometimes reporting to other organizational units such as legal, marketing, or human resources. Learning the subfunctions and the lexicon of terminology associated with this function is crucial to understanding how to manage an integrated and effective public relations function. The following subfunctions will be discussed in more detail later in this volume.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">Although there are many subfunctions that make up public relations, most people would identify two major types, corporate and agency. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Corporate</a><span class="glossdef">An in-house type of public relations that functions to create relationships between an organization and its various publics.</span></span>, or “in-house,” is a part of the organization or business. It functions to create relationships between an organization and its various publics. The second type of subfunction is associated with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public relations agency</a><span class="glossdef">A type of company whose purpose is to assist an organization in a specific area of expertise.  Generally, a public relations agency will assist an organization in promoting goodwill between itself and the public.</span></span>; its purpose is to assist organizations in a specific area of expertise.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Typical Corporate Public Relations Subfunctions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">It is important to note that each subfunction may differ according to organizational structure and size, as we discuss in <a class="xref" href="bowen_1.0-ch05#bowen_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Organizational Factors for Excellent Public Relations"</a>, “Organizational Factors Contributing to Excellent Public Relations.” Sometimes the public relations subfunctions overlap and one department (or even one person) is responsible for many or all of these activities. Large organizations, particularly those with multiple locations doing business internationally, will sometimes have multiple units covering just one of these subspecialties in public relations. Oftentimes the public relations function is structured with a separate department handling each of the responsibilities.</p>
