<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 3</span> Models and Approaches to Public Relations</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_p01">Although there were ancient public relations—as far in the past as ancient Greece—modern-day public relations in the United States began with a group of revolutionaries mounting a public relations campaign to turn public opinion in favor of independence from England and King George. The revolutionaries effectively used words and actions to mount a successful activist campaign leading to the Revolutionary War. Thomas Paine’s <em class="emphasis">Common Sense</em>, published in 1776, gave rise to the sentiment that England’s governance under King George III was unjust. The subsequent <em class="emphasis">Declaration of Independence</em> and outward acts of protest were largely influenced by the rhetorical arguments found in Paine’s pamphlet, which has been called the most influential tract of the American Revolution. Slogans, such as <em class="emphasis">Don’t Tread on Me</em>, and use of printed materials, such as Colonial newspapers, were key message tactics used to sway opinion in favor of a revolution and a war for independence. Following the independence, <em class="emphasis">The Federalist Papers</em> were used to ratify the United States Constitution. These 85 essays were, according to the assessment of Grunig and Hunt, exemplary forms of effective public relations.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_001">Grunig and Hunt (1984).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_p02">These founding fathers of the United States used public relations to build the public consensus necessary for a budding nation to form a new kind of government and establish the human rights necessary for the nation to survive.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">3.1</span> The Historical Development of Modern Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">Modern public relations in the United States can also be traced back to less illustrious beginnings than the creation of a new democratic republic.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_002">Cutlip (1995).</span> P. T. Barnum, of circus fame, made his mark by originating and employing many publicity or press agentry tactics to generate attention for his shows and attractions. Barnum was famous for coining the phrase, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_003">Grunig and Hunt (1984), p. 28.</span> He was even known to pen letters to the editor under an assumed name outing some of his attractions as hoaxes just to generate publicity and keep a story alive. Unfortunately, Barnum’s ethics left much to be desired.</p>
    <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">One-Way Communication Models: Publicity and Dissemination of Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Barnum thought that honesty was not the domain of a press agent, and infamously stated, “The public be fooled.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_004">Grunig and Hunt (1984), p. 29.</span> Droves of press agents followed in Barnum’s tracks, in efforts to get free space in the news for their clients, ranging from Hollywood figures to private interests, such as railroads, and also politicians. This approach to public relations was termed <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">press agentry</a><span class="glossdef">A type of public relations in which press agents attempt to generate publicity for their clients with little regard to the truth; it is based on a simple one-way dissemination of information. Historically, it is the first type of public relations.  Contrast with <em class="emphasis">public information</em>.</span></span> by Grunig and Hunt because of its reliance on generating publicity with little regard for truth. For modern-day examples, we have to look only to the entertainment publicity surrounding a new film release, or the product publicity around a new energy drink or a new technological gadget. Publicity and press agentry are synonymous terms meaning simply to generate attention through the use of media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">The next historical phase resulted in a new model of public relations that Grunig and Hunt termed <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public information</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to public relations in which public relations specialists use objective and factual information to educate the public about their clients.  It is used especially in government reporting, quarterly earnings statements, and reports.  Based on a one-way dissemination of information, it is simply intended to inform. Contrast with <em class="emphasis">press agentry</em>.</span></span>. In this approach to public relations, a former journalist works as a writer representing clients, issuing news releases to media outlets in the same style as journalistic writing. The idea of the public relations specialist acting as a counselor to management, as opposed to a simple practitioner of press agentry tactics, was born. The pioneering public information <em class="emphasis">counselor</em> was a man named Ivy Ledbetter Lee, who revolutionized public relations practice at the time with the idea of telling the truth. Lee studied at Harvard Law School, but went on to find a job as a journalist. After working as a successful journalist for a number of years, Ivy Lee realized that he had a real ability for explaining complicated topics to people, and had the idea of being a new kind of press agent. Rather than tricking the public, Lee saw his role as one of educating the public about truthful facts and supplying all possible information to the media. Ivy Lee opened the third public relations agency in the United States in 1904, representing clients such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Rockefeller family, and the Anthracite Coal Roads and Mine Company.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_005">Grunig and Hunt (1984), p. 32.</span> Lee became the first public relations practitioner to issue a code of ethics in 1906, based on his declaration that “the public be informed”—to replace railroad tycoon Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt’s infamous statement, “The public be damned.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn03_006">Hiebert (1966), p. 54.</span> Ivy Lee ushered in a more respectable form of public relations that is objective and factual. His public information approach is still in use today, especially in government reporting, quarterly earnings statements, and similar reports intended simply to inform.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">Both the press agentry and public information models of public relations are based on writing and technical skill with images, words, Web sites, and media relations. These concepts are based on a one-way dissemination of information. They are not management-based models because strategic management is based on research. Research is what makes management a strategic pursuit based on knowledge and data that comprise two-way communication, as opposed to a simple one-way dissemination of information based on assumptions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Two-Way Communication Models: Strategic Management of Public Relations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">The next two models of public relations are based on research. Using research to gather public opinion data led scholars to label these models two-way rather than one-way because they more resemble a conversation than a simple dissemination of information. Grunig and Hunt termed the two management models <em class="emphasis">asymmetrical</em> and <em class="emphasis">symmetrical</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">asymmetrical model</a><span class="glossdef">A research-based, two-way model of communication in which the imbalance of information favors the communicator.  The public's beliefs about an organization or issue of importance is incorporated into the public relations messages distributed by the organization.  The information presented seeks to persuade the public to adopt the attitudes and beliefs that are favorable to the organization.</span></span> was pioneered between 1920 and 1950 by Edward Bernays, nephew of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and is based on the principles of behavioral psychology. Public relations research seeks to determine what publics know and understand or believe about the client organization, issues of importance, and so on. Then, in the asymmetrical model, once these beliefs are learned through polling and other means, they are incorporated into the public relations messages distributed by the organization. It is called asymmetrical because it is imbalanced in favor of the communicator; the communicator undergoes no real change, but simply uses the ideas she knows will resonate in communicating with publics with the purpose of persuading them on some issue or topic. For example, if I am a politician running for reelection and my research identifies tax cuts as an important topic with publics, then I include the importance of tax cuts in my next campaign speech. Research is a key component of this model, as it seeks to persuade publics to adopt the attitudes and beliefs that are favorable to the organization based on the collection of data about their existent beliefs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">symmetrical model</a><span class="glossdef">A research-based, two-way model of public relations in which research is used not with the intent to persuade but to build mutual understanding between publics and organizations.  It is a collaborative approach to building understanding in which organizations are open to changing internal policy based on what they learn from the public.</span></span> was also pioneered by Edward Bernays and several prominent public relations practitioners and educators between about 1960 to 1980. It seeks also to use research on public opinion just as the asymmetrical model does. However, it does not use research with the intent to persuade, but to build mutual understanding between both publics and organizations. Organizations are open to changing their internal policies and practices in this model based on what they learn from their publics. It is a collaborative approach to building understanding, and, although not perfectly balanced, it is a <em class="emphasis">moving equilibrium</em> in which both sides in the communication process have an opportunity to have input and change an issue. To revise this example, after research identifying tax cuts as an issue, a symmetrical politician would actually incorporate tax cuts into her belief system and offer ideas supporting those beliefs on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p04">In modern public relations, we often see a mixing of the public relations models among multiple tactics or communication tools within one public relations campaign. It is best to think of the models as theoretical constructs that, in implementation, become combined through the mixed motives of public relations. In most cases, public relations professionals not only want to aid their employer or client but also to assist the publics outside the organization to access and understand the inner workings of the firm. This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mixed-motive approach</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to public relations that facilitates communication on both sides of an issue, both for organizations and for publics. In this approach, public relations professionals not only want to aid their employer or client, but also to assist the publics outside the organization to access and understand the inner workings of the firm.</span></span> is based on the real-world contingencies that impact public relations decisions, and the desire to facilitate communication on both sides of an issue, both for organizations and for publics.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Summary of the Models of Public Relations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">In summary, the historical development of the field showed four distinct models of public relations, as identified by Grunig and Hunt. With this brief background in the history of public relations, you likely know enough about the models now to begin employing each in your public relations management. All are still in use in public relations practice today, and these terms are used in the academic literature and in public relations management. The one-way models are not based on social scientific research but on a simple dissemination of information. The two-way models are based on research, which is what makes them the two-way management model. In order of their development, the models are as follows:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li> <strong class="emphasis bold">Press agentry</strong>. One-way (information) dissemination focusing on publicity for persuasion/attention.</li>
                <li> <strong class="emphasis bold">Public information</strong>. One-way (information) dissemination providing information.</li>
                <li> <strong class="emphasis bold">Two-way asymmetrical</strong>. Two-way (research), which is imbalanced in favor of persuading publics to support the organizations’ interests.</li>
                <li> <strong class="emphasis bold">Two-way symmetrical</strong>. Two-way (research), which is more balanced in terms of creating mutual understanding; moving equilibrium.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p02">Due to the <em class="emphasis">mixed-motives</em> inherent in the public relations process, public relations professionals will most likely use a combination of these models in public relations management. These models suggest an overall philosophy of public relations, while situations require different approaches. Therefore, it is also useful to have public relations strategies that reflect a contingency of varying approaches, as discussed later in this volume.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">3.2</span> The Subfunctions of Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_p01">Before we delve deeper into the profession, we would like to introduce you to the subfunctions or specialties within public relations. Think of the public relations function as a large umbrella profession encompassing many subfunctions. Those subfunctions are often independent units within an organization, sometimes reporting to public relations and sometimes reporting to other organizational units such as legal, marketing, or human resources. Learning the subfunctions and the lexicon of terminology associated with this function is crucial to understanding how to manage an integrated and effective public relations function. The following subfunctions will be discussed in more detail later in this volume.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">Although there are many subfunctions that make up public relations, most people would identify two major types, corporate and agency. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Corporate</a><span class="glossdef">An in-house type of public relations that functions to create relationships between an organization and its various publics.</span></span>, or “in-house,” is a part of the organization or business. It functions to create relationships between an organization and its various publics. The second type of subfunction is associated with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public relations agency</a><span class="glossdef">A type of company whose purpose is to assist an organization in a specific area of expertise.  Generally, a public relations agency will assist an organization in promoting goodwill between itself and the public.</span></span>; its purpose is to assist organizations in a specific area of expertise.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Typical Corporate Public Relations Subfunctions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">It is important to note that each subfunction may differ according to organizational structure and size, as we discuss in <a class="xref" href="bowen_1.0-ch05#bowen_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Organizational Factors for Excellent Public Relations"</a>, “Organizational Factors Contributing to Excellent Public Relations.” Sometimes the public relations subfunctions overlap and one department (or even one person) is responsible for many or all of these activities. Large organizations, particularly those with multiple locations doing business internationally, will sometimes have multiple units covering just one of these subspecialties in public relations. Oftentimes the public relations function is structured with a separate department handling each of the responsibilities.</p>
        <div class="section" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Issues Management</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Issues management</a><span class="glossdef">A forward-thinking function of corporate public relations that is responsible for identifying and solving problems, and also for identifying trends, industry changes, and other potential issues that could impact an organization.

Issues management is the forward-thinking, problem-solving, management-level function responsible for identifying problems, trends, industry changes, and other potential issues that could impact the organization. Issues management requires a formidable knowledge of research, environmental monitoring, the organization’s industry and business model, and management strategy.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">3.3</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s03_p01">This chapter has provided the basic knowledge of public relations models and subfunctions (both corporate and agency) necessary to understand and expand your knowledge of this vast and ever-changing profession. The models and subfunctions are those that generally comprise public relations, although they do vary by industry. The organization size, type, amount of government regulation, and even the organization’s competition will determine whether it has all or some of these subfunctions present in-house, outsources them as needed, or relies on public relations agencies. Normally an organization will have a majority of the subfunctions on this list. They may be structured as part of the public relations department, or as independent units reporting to it, to another function, or to senior management.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch03_s03_p02">Knowing the terminology related to the subfunctions helps to identify different forms of public relations and combinations of these efforts in practice. In order to achieve the most with public relations initiatives, it is important to know which subfunctions must exist, which work well with one another, and which need independence or autonomy. Further in the book, we will apply this knowledge to examine the structuring of the public relations department and subfunctions. We will examine how organizational structure has an impact on the models of public relations employed and the subfunctions that exist in practice.</p>
