<span class="title-prefix">5.4</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">In this chapter, we reviewed findings from the <em class="emphasis">Excellence Study</em> and other sources about the important impact that organizational culture and structure have on the communication function, the view the CEO holds of the public relations practice, and the reasons for encouraging a participative organizational culture as a factor that builds effectiveness. Research supports the notion that public relations is more effective for organizations when it is valued by the dominant coalition or C-suite, the organizational structure is relatively decentralized allowing decision-making autonomy, and there is a direct reporting line between the CCO and the CEO. Further, the <em class="emphasis">Excellence Study</em> argued that the best organizations value participation and diversity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch05_s04_p02">Obviously, these organizational factors are going to vary from organization to organization, and the structure and organizational cultural elements often reflect the unique needs of each.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn05_011">Argenti (2007).</span> Some may be more centralized and more participative in culture, whereas others might be more decentralized but less participative.</p>
