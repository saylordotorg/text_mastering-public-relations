    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch09_s02_p01">This chapter reviewed the process by which strategic public relations efforts are accomplished. The process is very structured. It suggests that formal research be conducted for formative and evaluative purposes. It requires connecting communication efforts with goals, objectives, and strategies. This process works best with planned efforts such as public relations campaigns. You may wonder how it fits for everyday tasks such as responding to a reporter’s inquiry or writing a speech for an employee meeting. Because these steps are required for strategic public relations, they fit everyday duties as well. Regardless of the situation, before acting or responding the public relations professional asks, “What do I know about this situation?” (situational analysis); “What do I want to accomplish with my messages?” (goals and objectives); “How will I accomplish this with my messages?” (strategy); and “What will I say?” (tactic). This process should be ingrained if the public relations professional is to become a strategic communicator.</p>
