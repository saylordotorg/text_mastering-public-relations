<span class="title-prefix">10.6</span> Nonprofit, NGO, and Activist Public Relations</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonprofit or not-for-profit groups</a><span class="glossdef">Groups that exist in order to educate, fund research, advocate, or lobby on behalf of a public cause or initiative.</span></span> are those that exist in order to educate, fund research, advocate, or lobby on behalf of a public cause or initiative. Oftentimes, nonprofit groups are those with an educational mission existing on behalf of the public interest. For instance, the Cancer Research Foundation of America educates consumers about what food products to eat to increase healthiness and lessen cancer risk. Public relations efforts on behalf of nonprofits generally involve disseminating public information, persuading publics to adopt the ideas of the organization through the use of press agentry and asymmetrical public relations, and the use of symmetrical public relations to increase donor funding and governmental funding of the initiative.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p02">Nonprofit public relations may exist for educational purposes, to promote an idea or cause, or to raise funds for research on an issue or problem. A well-known example would be the many cancer research foundations that exist to raise awareness about cancer and its risk factors, educate the public about preventive measures, lobby the government for further funding of cancer research, and occasionally provide grants for cancer study. Much of nonprofit public relations includes lobbying the government through educating legislators about the problem, ongoing research initiatives, and how the government can increase support for both funding and preventive measures. Nonprofit public relations often relies heavily on member relations, meaning that it seeks to maintain and develop relationships with supportive publics who can distribute the organization’s message, and often pay a membership fee to assist in providing an operational budget for the nonprofit. Member relations is often conducted through the use of Internet Web sites, magazines, newsletters, and special events. <strong class="emphasis bold">Fund-raising</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">development</strong> is the final, vital part of nonprofit public relations. Development is tasked with raising funds from both large fund donors, writing grants for governmental support, and conducting fund-raising with smaller, private donors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nongovernmental organizations</a><span class="glossdef">Groups who exist in order to carry out initiatives, such as humanitarian tasks, that governments are not willing to handle. NGOs often form around social issues and do not have the profit motivation of corporations.</span></span>, or NGOs, are “soft-power” groups who do not hold the political appointees of governmental agencies, and do not have the profit motivation of corporations. They exist in order to carry out initiatives, such as humanitarian tasks, that governments are not willing to handle. NGOs often form around social issues or causes to act in concert with the government but not to be controlled by it, although their sovereignty is at question in some nations. The employees of NGOs are often former government workers or officials. NGOs often partner with local groups or leaders to accomplish specific initiatives. Gass and Seiter noted that “non-governmental (NGOs) also are particularly good at demonstrating goodwill” and that goodwill is a part of establishing credibility.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_020">Gass and Seiter (2009), p. 160.</span> They explained, “Goodwill is much more likely to be communicated via ‘soft power’”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_021">Gass and Seiter (2009), p. 160.</span> such as NGOs. Examples would be groups such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Activist groups</a><span class="glossdef">Special-interest groups that arise around an organization in order to establish change related to their particular issue of concern. They normally arise from a grassroots movement.</span></span> are special interest groups that arise around an organization in order to establish some type of change around their particular issue of concern. Activist groups normally arise from a “grassroots movement,” meaning that it comes from everyday citizens rather than those who work in government. That fact makes it slightly different from an NGO and oftentimes activist groups are less official in the formal structure of their organization and its nonprofit status, compared to nonprofits or NGOs. Activist groups can be small and informal, such as a local group of parents banding together to protest a school board decision, or they can be large and more organized, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p05">Activist groups can differ in their purposes and reasons for existing, and in the amount of action-taking behavior that they undertake. For example, some activist groups are termed “obstructionist” because they obstruct a resolution to the problem in order to gain media notoriety for their issue and new membership. Greenpeace is an example of an obstructionist activist group.<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_022">Murphy and Dee (1992), pp. 3–20.</span> Other activist groups might use more collaborative or integrative strategies of problem solving in an attempt to resolve their problems with an organization and have those changes integrated into organizational policy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p06">Activist groups also differ in the issue with which they are concerned, with some issues being broadly defined (such as “the environment”) and other issues being very specific (such as “toxic waste runoff”). Grunig’s study on activist group’s issues is informative here; she found that “two out of every three activist groups were concerned with a single issue.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_023">Grunig (1992a), p. 515.</span> That single issue could be as specific as the impending destruction of a local, historic building. Or it could be a larger issue such as the amount of pollutants exuded from a manufacturing process.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_p07">Activist groups exert power on organizations in many forms of pressure, such as appearances at “town hall” type meetings, rallies and demonstrations, boycotts, anti–Web sites, e-mail campaigns, letter-writing campaigns, phone calls to legislators, lobbying, and events designed specifically to garner media attention. Activist groups are usually filled with young, educated, and motivated ideologues with a strong devotion to acting on behalf of their cause. These groups are normally quite effective in their efforts to have organizations integrate their values into organizational policy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How to Respond to Activism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_s01_p01">Organizations might attempt to “ignore” activist pressure, but that approach simply does not work because it often prolongs or exacerbates the activist group’s campaign. When the organization stonewalls, activist groups normally approach elected officials and ask for the organization to be investigated, fined, and regulated. Activists also employ various forms of media that can both influence legislators and change public opinion, building support for their perspective that can be used in creating turbulence for the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_s01_p02">The most effective way that public relations can deal with activist groups is to engage them in a give-and-take or symmetrical dialogue to discover their issues of concern, values, wants, and priorities. Collaborative efforts to resolve conflict normally lessen the damage resulting from conflict for organizations; refusing to deal with activist groups protracts the dispute. The efficacy of activist groups, even very small ones, is well documented in the public relations body of knowledge. The <em class="emphasis">Excellence Study</em> contends that “regardless of the link of the dispute, the intensity of the conflict or the media coverage involved… all activist groups studied had disrupted the target organization.”<span class="footnote" id="bowen_1.0-fn10_024">Grunig (1992a), p. 523.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Integrative Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="bowen_1.0-ch10_s06_s02_p01">Holding face-to-face meetings with activist leaders and members, brainstorming sessions, or joint “summits” tend to work well in building understanding between the organization and its activist. The activist group must also understand the organization’s business model and constraints, and the requirements of the regulatory environment in which it operates. Asking for the opinion of activists on organizational policy is never a popular idea with senior management; however, it can result in novel adaptations of those ideas that provide a win-win solution to issues. Hearing and valuing the concerns of activist sometimes offers enough resolution to their dilemma for them to target less collaborative organizations. The crucial point of your response is that activists must be included rather than ignored. Using conflict resolution, negotiation skill, and symmetrical dialogue to understand the activist group helps the public relations professional incorporate their ideas into strategic decision making. A collaborative approach lessens the damage that activists cause to the reputation of the organization, as well as the amount of resources and time that must be spent on responding to activist pressure.</p>
